# Minesweeper
It's the famous game Minesweeper. There are three difficulty levels. It's possible that you may have to guess in order to solve the game. I didn't take that into account when making the algorithm to generate the boards.

## Controls
To run the game you have to run main.java (no executables here).

Left click to reveal a square and right click to toggle a flag. To change difficulty just click on the desired difficulty on the side of the window. You can also reset the game by clicking on the same difficulty that is already selected.

## Misc
Made with Java's AWT API.
